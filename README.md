# Milestone 1 


### Proposed Level of Achievement: Gemini



### Motivation

Have you ever wondered how much calories you are intaking from the food you eat? Especially in Singapore, where there are a broad range of delicacies and cuisines, and sometimes searching for the calories of a particular local food online, roasted char siew pork rice, may not give you the exact results you want, or it might take a little more deeper searching for you to find out their calories.


### Aim

We hope to provide a more convenient and efficient calorie database of local foods for users, so that they can track their calories easily.


### User Stories:

1. As a user, I want the database to be easy to navigate, and accurate in providing me with the searches I am looking for.

2. I do not want to have too many conflicting options when searching for a particular food, so as to make the tracking of calories more straightforward and less of a hassle for us.

3. I want to be able to see the nutritional information of the food, together with the calories, so that I would be able to track not just the number of calories I am eating, but also track my intake of healthy nutrients.


### Scope of Project:

Our website will have a database of local food and beverages where users can find out how much calories any food or drink contains and its nutritional information. It will also provide estimated amount of exercises to burn off the calories the particular food or drink contains. 

#### How are we different from a similar platform?

* MyFitnessPal
  * For our website, we will only have 1 search result for any valid entry so there is no ambiguity. Searching for an item on myFitnessPal may yield several results which can confuse users and they may not know which is the correct one they should be looking at. Also, our website only contains local food and beverages, mainly targeted at the Singaporean community.
